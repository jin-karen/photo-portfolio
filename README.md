# photo-portfolio
understand insta api - graph vs basic, diff deprecated embed options, etc.
not dynamic api photo bc business embed 
instead, going to have folder for images
trying to learn and use node.js to access files in script and display
learn node.js first to learn how to do so without backend framework for server
prob need to do node.js only no framework for now - do express in the future

future would also want to use express to use a database for travel photos - with 
relationship to continent it was taken - currently not enough pictures posted so using a carousel
