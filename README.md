# photo-portfolio
## Description
A photo portfolio website built for a food instagram account using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allowed the opportunity to provide a service and build a site for a mock-client that showcases their portfolio, includes an about me, and includes a slideshow for travel photos. 

This project showcases existing fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allowed me to expand my knowledge on building specific components from scratch. Learned components include a dark mode toggle (maintained across multiple pages with sessionStorage), a responsive navigation bar with collapsible content, adding in a typewriter effect, slideshow with a corresponding caption and gallery, etc.

## To Run
Live: https://jin-karen.github.io/photo-portfolio/

Project was coded for 1920x1080 display resolution and adjustments were made for smaller screens.
Desktop chrome usage at 1920x1080 is recommended for best viewing and interacting experience.

## Process
Initially, the project portfolio was intended to make a call to Instagram API to get and embed the food instagram's posts in the website. However, due to Instagram API's policy that the oEmbed Read feature is only available for businesses, the project track switched to using file storage and Document Object Model (DOM) to create and append images.

The intent to improve this project in the future is to utilize Node.js and Express to create an API that can be called to dynamically return the images from the file storage or a database.
